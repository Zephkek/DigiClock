# Vintage Digital Clock Project

This repository features my high school digital clock project (the first revision), built on classic electronic components. It’s a throwback to the fundamentals of digital electronics, constructed from vintage parts that showcase the evolution of digital clocks. Originally posted on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1bd8fw8/what_do_you_guys_think_of_my_highschool_ee_project/), this project represents my exciting journey through my early interest in electrical engineering back then.

## Project Overview

- **Built with:** Traditional digital ICs, old-school displays, and discrete electronic components.
- **Design Objective:** Construct a fully functional digital clock from scratch, incorporating logic circuits, counters, and a manual layout.
- **Timeline:** High school final project, shared with the community years ago.

## Features

- **Timekeeping:** Uses a simple oscillator and counter to keep time.
- **Display:** Displays hours, minutes, and seconds on an LED display.
- **Alarm:** You can setup alarms on the fly.


## Project Background

During my high school years, this project was my introduction to practical circuit design. It’s been a fascinating experience to work with timeless components and learn the basics of digital electronics.
